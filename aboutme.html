      <p>
        Iâ€™m <strong>Aarthi Sridharan</strong> â€” a Product Lead & Strategist with 8+ years leading AI-powered, platform-scale products at Meta, Amazon, Expedia, Domino Data Lab, and high-growth startups.
        Iâ€™ve delivered $300M+ in revenue impact, 30% cost reductions, and frameworks that help teams think and evolve intelligently.
        <br><br>
        Through <strong>Harmonic Path</strong>, I support founders and teams in turning vision, intent, and signal into systems that scale with clarity, empathy, and resonance.
        I bring the knowledge of years of experience and learning to help define resonant MVPs, design thoughtful experiments, and translate insight into growth systems that evolve with their users.

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-700">ðŸŒ€ The Harmonic Lens</h3>
      <p><strong>Great products emerge from intentionâ€”not force. Innovation, when rooted in care, honors human complexity and listens beyond the loudest voice.</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong>Harmonic Path</strong> is where vision, signal, and experience converge in clarity.
        I believe resonant products begin with listeningâ€”not assumptions or forecasts, but real-time intent shaped by empathy.
        I partner to build living systems that sense intent, adapt through feedback, and foster lasting trust.

        When intent, insight, and design move in harmony, the result is more than a product â€”  
        itâ€™s a <strong>system that becomes</strong>. Clarity turns to momentum, resonance attracts, and growth unfolds naturally.
