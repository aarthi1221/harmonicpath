      <p class="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed font-medium">
        Iâ€™m <strong>Aarthi Sridharan</strong> â€” a Product Lead & Strategist who helps founders and teams turn signal into systems that scale with <strong>clarity, empathy, and resonance</strong>.

      <p class="text-base leading-relaxed max-w-2xl mx-auto">
        <strong>The future of AI is harmonic</strong> â€” signal-driven systems where humans and AI co-evolve through intent, learning with empathy and designing with clarity.

    <!-- How I Think -->

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-700">ðŸŒ€ The Harmonic Lens</h3>
      <p><strong>Great products emerge from intentionâ€”not force. Innovation, when rooted in care, honors human complexity and listens beyond the loudest voice.</strong><br>
      Resonant products begin with listeningâ€”not assumptions or forecasts, but real-time intent shaped by empathy. I focus on building living systems that sense intent, adapt through feedback, and foster lasting trust.</p>
      <p><strong>Harmonic Path</strong> is where vision, signal, and experience converge in clarity. I partner with founders building at the edge â€” crafting signal-driven architectures that evolve with users and scale through resonance.</p>

        When intent, insight, and design move in harmony, the result is more than a product â€”  
        itâ€™s a <strong>system that becomes</strong>. Clarity turns to momentum, resonance attracts, and growth unfolds naturally.
