        <strong>The future of AI is harmonic</strong><br>
        Signal-driven systems where humans and AI co-evolve, learning with empathy while honoring the whole, not just the loudest.</h4>

        Iâ€™m <strong>Aarthi Sridharan</strong> â€” a Product Lead & Strategist who helps founders and teams turn signal into systems that scale with <strong>clarity, empathy, and resonance</strong>.10+ years leading <strong>AI-powered, platform-scale products</strong> at Meta, Amazon, Expedia, Domino Data Lab, and startups.
      Delivered <strong>$300M+ revenue impact</strong>, 30% cost reduction, and frameworks that help organizations <strong>think and evolve intelligently</strong>.In practice, I help enterpreneus and teams define resonant MVPs, design thoughtful experiments, and translate insight into growth systems that evolve with their users.

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-700">ðŸŒ€ The Harmonic Lens</h3>
      <p><strong>Great products emerge from intentionâ€”not force. Innovation, when rooted in care, honors human complexity and listens beyond the loudest voice.</strong><br>
      Resonant products begin with listeningâ€”not assumptions or forecasts, but real-time intent shaped by empathy. I focus on building living systems that sense intent, adapt through feedback, and foster lasting trust.</p>
      <p><strong>Harmonic Path</strong> is where vision, signal, and experience converge in clarity. I partner with founders building at the edgeâ€”crafting signal-driven architectures that evolve with users and scale through resonance.</p>

        When intent, insight, and design move in harmony, the result is more than a product â€”  
        itâ€™s a <strong>system that becomes</strong>. Clarity turns to momentum, resonance attracts, and growth unfolds naturally.
