    <p class="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-[#0F1020]/90 mb-10">
      I’m <strong>Aarthi Sridharan</strong> — a <strong>Product & AI Leader</strong> who builds systems that scale with clarity, empathy, and resonance.
      My work bridges strategy, design, and data to create technology that honors human intent.
    </p>

    <p class="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#0F1020]/90 mb-6">
      Over the past decade, I’ve shaped AI-powered, platform-scale products across <strong>Meta, Amazon, Expedia, Domino Data Lab</strong>,
      and high-growth startups—leading cross-functional teams from ambiguity to alignment and impact.
      My products have driven <strong>$300M+ in revenue</strong>, reduced infrastructure costs by <strong>30%</strong>,
      and built frameworks that help organizations think, learn, and evolve more intelligently.
    </p>

    <p class="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#0F1020]/90 mb-6">
      Through <strong>Harmonic Path</strong>, I bring this philosophy to founders, product teams, and growth-stage organizations
      seeking to turn <em>signal into strategy</em> and <em>strategy into resonance</em>.
      Whether shaping an early-stage product vision or orchestrating large-scale transformation,
      my goal is to design with precision and purpose—crafting experiences that connect deeply and scale gracefully.

      I believe great products emerge when technology listens—when we design from understanding, not assumption.
      My work is about turning complexity into clarity, insight into action, and systems into stories that resonate.
